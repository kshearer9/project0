              Once upon a time, there lived a group of flowers. They were Tulip,
              Sunflower, Cactus, Cosmos and Daisy. One day, all the flowers bloomed
              beautifully but only Cactus did not bloom a flower and all the
              other flowers teased him for this.
            </p>
            <p>
              Soon, it was a rainy day and all the plants were happily drinking
              water. Sunflower shouted "Hey Cactus! You don't need
              to drink any water because you can't bloom any flowers". The Cosmos
              said, "Only pretty flowers can drink the water". On hearing this,
              Tulip and Daisy started to laugh. Poor Cactus was hurt and kept
              quiet.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the hot summer approached, the garden began to dry up. All of
              the flowers were suffering under the hot weather except Cactus.
              Cactus asked her fellow flowers, "Hey, are you okay?" The Sunflower
              told her, "The weather is too hot, I'm thirsty!" The Cosmos said,
              "Help! The Sun is killing me!" The Tulip said "Please water me or
              else I'll die!" The Daisy cried, "I'm so thirsty!"
            </p>
            <p>
              But all the flowers were amazed at Cactus. Finally, the Sunflower
              asked, "Cactus, why don't you feel thirsty?" "Because I have a
              long root that spreads out just under the ground in search of water.
              Without leaves, less water is lost through my body. So I can store
              a lot of water", Cactus replied.
            </p>
            <p>
              "If you don't mind, I have water and I can help you all", Cactus
              told the other flowers. Cosmos, Daisy and Tulip said, "We are
              sorry, Cactus!" The Sunflower said "I'm sorry, Cactus! We treated
              you so bad and yet you are still willing to help us!" Cactus
              replied, "No problem! I'm doing what I know is right!"
            </p>
            <p>
              After what had happened, all the flowers stopped teasing Cactus
              and were so grateful to her for saving their lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Suddenly, a fairy appeared in front of them. The fairy said, "I have seen
              what you have done for the others and I'm touched by your actions.
              Now I'm going to help you by making your wish come true". As the
              fairy moved her magic want, Cactus suddenly grew a beautiful
              flower like the rest of the plants and all of them lived happily
              ever after.
